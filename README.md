# C3D

# IMPORTANT NOTE
C3D is currently under reconstruction to allow for a much higher performance and a more featurefilled and customizable api!
This rebuild is a complete rewrite of the pipeline and major changes to the api and internals. All the work that has been done on that so far can be found in the dev branch
the master branch should be still fully working and up to what the documentation claims

09.07.23 - while it may seem like there is no actual work being done in the repo i have been working locally
i will only push the branches once V2 is fully complete (which it is still not even close to being, pipeline is still fully missing)
however the currently planned stuff/finished/in-progress stuff can be viewed at https://github.com/users/9551-Dev/projects/2/views/1
if you have a feature request or wanna comment or any feature feel free to make an issue on this repository
